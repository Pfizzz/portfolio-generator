## Description
According to "See-Turtles," an internet database dedicated to turtle research, "Most sea turtles migrate between foraging and nesting grounds, and seasonally to warmer waters. Often these migrations take them hundreds and even thousands of miles. With satellite telemetry, scientists can track the movements of sea turtles between areas and even across entire oceans." This app tracks these movements.
